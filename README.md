# 3DTrackerPy
OpenCV Python Kalman Filter based 3D tracker

 - Tracks X,Y,Z
 - Includes the effect of gravity in the model (free-fall model)
 - Includes effect of wind resistence / drag in the model.

Read/explore [Jupyter notebook visualize_3d_points-ball3.ipynb](visualize_3d_points-ball3.ipynb) to learn how to use this tracker. This notebook also shows how to predict the trajectory of the object when no measurement data is available (blue is predicted trajectory in the notebook; orange is the measurement data).
